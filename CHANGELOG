  * Scope condition properly quotes foreign key values (e.g "parent_id = '1'")
  * Removed logic that converts scopes that are belongs_to symbols into foreign keys. This will require you to specifically pass the foreign key as a symbol now (e.g. :parent_id instead of :parent) which allows to scope to fields like :type
  * Updated documentation
